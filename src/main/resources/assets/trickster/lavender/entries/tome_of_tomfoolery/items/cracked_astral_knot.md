Somehow, cracking an Astral Knot has increased its capacity by a truly staggering amount.
Its initially already insane maximum of 1048 kG has been multiplied by a factor of 16, to roughly 16.8 MG.

;;;;;

As a seeming tradeoff though, the Knots inherent mana regeneration ability has been completely crippled.
It works the complete opposite of how it used to, now **draining** mana at a rate proportional to the amount it contains.
